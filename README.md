# TailwindCSS-projects

Welcome to my TailwindCSS practice repository! This repository contains three mini-projects I built to enhance my skills with TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The projects are:

    **Branding-App** - A simple branding application UI.
    **Photography** - A photography portfolio showcase.
    **Web Agency** - A landing page for a fictional web agency.

Each project is self-contained and demonstrates practical applications of TailwindCSS for responsive and modern web design.
